        <ul class="features">
            <li>Both data and instructions are stored in the same memory</li>
            <li>There are advantages to this such as making devices cheaper but also meaning that only 1 memory location can be accessed at once.</li>
            <li>This differs to the Harvard architecture which has separate memories for data and instructions.</li>
